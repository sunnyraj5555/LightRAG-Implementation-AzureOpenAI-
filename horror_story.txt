It was a dark and stormy night when five friends, Alex, Ben, Clara, Diana, and Ethan, decided to explore the abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. The mansion had a reputation for being haunted, and the locals often spoke of strange occurrences and eerie sounds emanating from within its walls.

As they approached the mansion, the wind howled through the trees, and the rain poured down in torrents. The old wooden door creaked open with a loud groan as they pushed it, revealing a dimly lit hallway covered in cobwebs. The air was thick with dust, and the smell of decay filled their nostrils.

"Are you sure this is a good idea?" Clara asked, her voice trembling with fear.

"Don't be such a scaredy-cat," Ben replied with a nervous laugh. "It's just an old house. There's nothing to be afraid of."

The group cautiously made their way through the mansion, their flashlights casting eerie shadows on the walls. They explored room after room, each one more decrepit than the last. The furniture was covered in white sheets, and the wallpaper was peeling off in large chunks.

In one of the rooms, they found an old diary lying on a dusty table. Diana picked it up and began to read aloud. The diary belonged to a woman named Eliza, who had lived in the mansion many years ago. According to her entries, she had been tormented by a malevolent spirit that haunted the house.

As Diana read on, strange things began to happen. The temperature dropped suddenly, and they could see their breath in the cold air. The sound of footsteps echoed through the halls, even though no one else was there. The friends huddled together, their fear growing with each passing moment.

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind them, trapping them inside the room. Alex tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. Panic set in as they realized they were not alone. A ghostly figure appeared before them, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

"Who dares to enter my domain?" the spirit hissed.

"We're sorry," Ethan stammered. "We didn't mean any harm."

The spirit's eyes narrowed as it floated closer. "You have disturbed my rest," it said. "Now you must pay the price."

The friends screamed as the spirit lunged at them. They tried to run, but their legs felt like lead. The ghost's icy touch sent shivers down their spines as it reached out to grab them.

Just when all hope seemed lost, Clara remembered something she had read about spirits being bound to certain objects. She looked around the room and spotted an old locket lying on the floor. She grabbed it and held it up to the ghost.

"Is this what you're looking for?" she asked.

The spirit stopped in its tracks and stared at the locket. Its expression softened, and it reached out to touch it. As soon as its fingers made contact with the locket, it let out a mournful wail and vanished into thin air.

The door creaked open, and the friends stumbled out of the room, their hearts pounding in their chests. They didn't stop running until they were safely outside the mansion.

"Let's never do that again," Alex said, his voice shaking.

"Agreed," Ben replied.

As they walked away from the mansion, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. They vowed never to speak of what had happened that night, but deep down, they knew that they would never forget their encounter with the vengeful spirit of Eliza.
