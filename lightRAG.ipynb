            "\n",
            "#### 1. **Fear and Courage**\n",
            "The theme of fear is prevalent throughout the story, starting from the moment the friends decide to explore the mansion. Clara's initial hesitation and trembling voice highlight the fear that grips the group. However, the story also showcases courage, particularly when Clara remembers the lore about spirits being bound to objects and uses the locket to confront the ghost. This act of bravery ultimately saves them.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 2. **Friendship and Unity**\n",
            "The friends' unity is a significant theme as they face the unknown together. Despite their fear, they stick together, supporting each other through the terrifying experience. Their collective effort to explore the mansion and their shared terror when confronted by the spirit underscore the strength of their bond.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 3. **The Supernatural**\n",
            "The supernatural is a central theme, with the haunted mansion, the malevolent spirit, and the eerie occurrences creating an atmosphere of suspense and horror. The diary of Eliza and the ghostly figure add layers to the supernatural elements, making the story a classic ghost tale.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 4. **Curiosity and Consequences**\n",
            "The friends' curiosity leads them to the mansion, despite its reputation for being haunted. This curiosity drives the plot forward but also brings about dire consequences.
